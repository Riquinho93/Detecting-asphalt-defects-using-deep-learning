# Detecting asphalt defects using deep learning

## Abstract

Repairing defects present in road asphalt is an important task to increase the comfort and safety of road users. In addition, it allows to avoid intense levels of wear on the asphalt, which also lead to higher repair costs. In many cases, those responsible for paved road maintenance notice or observe road defects only when a serious accident occurs. And this could be avoided if there was greater concern with detecting and quickly repairing these irregularities on the highways. A more economical and profitable way is to prevent these road failures from becoming an obstacle. For this, it is necessary to identify the defects even before an accident occurs to defray the cost of maintenance and insecurity problems on the highways. Automating this process with object recognition techniques can bring greater safety in traffic, due to a better organization of roads that need maintenance. The objective of this work is to build a defect recognition algorithm in digital images and videos of asphalts through Deep learning. We will use Yolo as our object detector, as it can predict objects in a few seconds. Our dataset consists of 613 images, spread over 317 crack images and 296 hole images. Although defect recognition is considered a difficult task, we obtained an average accuracy of 96% in our best model.


Keywords: Yolo, object detection, Deep learning.

# Introduction

Chapter 1 is dedicated to an introduction to the theme of the work, describing the general ideas of the problem and its importance. In addition, the objectives of the work and a structure of the report are explicit.

## 1.1 Framework

According to the World Bank, referenced in the G1 [1], among the main world economies, Brazil has the highest concentration of road transport for passengers and passengers. Not Brazil, 58% of cargo transport is carried out by road - then we have Australia with 53%, China with 50%, Russia with 43% and 8% in Canada. Finally, a road network is used to transport 75% of production in Brazil. These data report the great importance of highways for countries.

A survey carried out on Brazilian highways by the National Transport Confederation (CNT) reported in the newspaper Metr√≥poles [2], pointed out that 59% of the highways had some type of problem. The entity analyzed 108 miles of paved roads. Knowing this, the conservation of highways

The correction of the highways is necessary to guarantee that the cargo flow is carried out quickly and efficiently, accelerating the economic development of Brazil, as shown by Rodrigues and Colmenero [3].

In addition to the economic factor, the bad categories of the highways are considered a determining factor in the occurrence of traffic accidents [4]. And with irregular roads, they provide various damages to vehicles that can lead to various types of accidents.

It is important to consider that there are other factors that determine a safe road such as traffic signs. However, the focus of the work is on the defects of paved roads.

To automate this process of detecting defects in digital images on asphalt, we will use Deep Learning (DL) techniques [29]. DL or deep learning in Portuguese, is a sub-area of Machine Learning (ML), machine learning translating into Portuguese. DL is a successive representation of convolutional layers (topic explained in chapter 2). And the total number of layers, two or more, that are part of the data model is required of model depth. In DL, there are several parameters and concepts that make this work possible.

Deep learning is no longer a trend, it has become a reality. With DL, incredible projects are being created between different professional areas. For example, performing analysis of symptoms and causes and suggesting medications for patients; To train robotic mechanisms for people who do not have legs and arms, or to classify by means of images whether or not a patient has a specific disease. All these ideas are derived from the medical field.

In agriculture, DL can analyze and monitor vegetation 24x7 (24 hours for 7 days) to detect any disease and suggest a possible pesticide. You can also analyze how to change the weather and suggest a particular vegetable for that type of field and climate. Furthermore, it is able to classify fruits and vegetables after cultivation in terms of quality.

DL can act as a voice assistant, understand a sentence of a sentence to be able to answer back. DL acts in autonomous cars, with a vehicle, sensors and a global location of the location and determining that the vehicle must travel a path to the target. DL also acts as a research and marketing manager, managing to analyze each user and identify their interests, making advertisements targeted at target users.

These are some of the other applications that make DL fascinating. Throughout the document, what is and how deep learning works is detailed, in addition to explaining in detail the proposal chosen in this work.

# Context and Technologies

This chapter describes the contents related to the problem solving knowledge area. Among them are artificial intelligence, computer vision, machine learning, artificial and convolutional neural networks, object detection, introduction to Yolo and evaluation metrics.

## 2.1 Artificial intelligence

Gooddfellow, Bengio and Courville [5] define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a thriving field with many practical applications and active research topics. This technology is seen as a way to automate routine work, understand speech or image, make medical diagnoses, and support basic scientific research. AI is not only the machine's ability to learn and understand from experience, but also to acquire and retain knowledge in models, containing the ability to respond quickly and accurately to new situations.

### 2.1.1 How does AI learn?

There are many ways to define intelligence, but Mueller and Massaron [30] describe certain norms that involve mental activities:
- Learning: having the ability to obtain and process new information.
- Reasoning: Being able to manipulate information in various ways.
- Understanding: Interpreting the results of the manipulation of information.
- Capture truths: Determine the validity of the manipulated information.
- Seeing relationships: Guessing how validated data interacts with other data.
- Considering meanings: Applying truths to particular situations in a way consistent with your relationship.
- Separating fact from belief: determining whether the data is adequately supported by verifiable sources that can be demonstrated to be consistently valid.

To accomplish these steps, the computer system follows an imitation process as part of a simulation:

- I. Set a goal based on needs or wants.
- II. Assess the value of any information currently known in support of the goal.
- III. Gather additional information that can support the goal.
- IV. Manipulate the data so that it achieves a form consistent with existing ones in formation.
- V. Define the true relationships and values between the existing and the new in formation.
- VI. Determine whether the goal has been achieved.
- VII. Modify the goal in light of the new data and its effect on the probability of success.

Repeat steps II to VII as needed until the goal is reached (considered true) or the possibilities of reaching it run out (considered false).

## Computer vision

The human being, in general, has no difficulty in identifying and classifying an object, can identify a sofa anywhere, with its various shapes (large, small, round, square, tall or short) and regardless of its position, horizontal or vertical. However, the machine does not have the same facility as us humans, for the machine it is necessary to go through a lot of training and with a large amount of example data to be able to identify and differentiate the objects. In other words, the difference between a person's learning from a computer is that if a person shows them an object and says it's a sofa, they can already identify other forms of sofas, regardless of whether it's day or night, from the first reference that you were taught. The machine, on the other hand, has difficulty in identifying an object if it is not given all the necessary information so that it can learn, for example, sofas during the day and at night. And the data should have little noise, or no noise at all, for there to be interference in the final result. This part of machine learning with images or videos is explained by computer vision. We will list 3 standard computer vision problems mentioned by Davies [31].

### Problem 1 - The recognition process

To explain this concept, see Figure 1. In part A, we have the data with a 25-bit set of information, together with an associated label. In part B, it is the test pattern of the model trained with data from part A. In this simple situation, it is possible to notice distortions in the results, illustrated by the test patterns (2) and (3). Especially, these problems arise where the test pattern is displaced or disoriented from the appropriate training set pattern, as is the case with the test pattern (6).

      However, there are some solutions to these problems, for example, standardizing the images in some way to make the test pattern as close as possible to a restricted set of patterns in the training set. One of them would be to normalize the position and orientation of any 2D image object.
